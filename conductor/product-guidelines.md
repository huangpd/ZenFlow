# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity
- **Style:** Zen Minimalist. Emphasizes clarity, calmness, and focus.
- **Color Palette:** Soft, neutral tones (e.g., sage green, warm beige, soft whites) to evoke tranquility. High contrast should be avoided unless necessary for accessibility.
- **Typography:** Clean, sans-serif fonts for readability, with serif accents for headings to add a touch of elegance and tradition.
- **Imagery:** Abstract, nature-inspired shapes or minimalist icons. Avoid cluttered or overly complex visuals.

## User Experience (UX) Principles
- **Simplicity First:** The interface should be intuitive and uncluttered, allowing users to focus on the content and their internal state.
- **Gentle Interactions:** Animations and transitions should be smooth and slow, mirroring the pace of meditation or deep thought.
- **Privacy & Safety:** Clear indicators of data locality and privacy to build trust.
- **Encouragement:** Subtle, positive reinforcement (like the celebration effects) without being gamified or intrusive.

## Brand Voice & Tone
- **Voice:** Compassionate, wise, and non-judgmental.
- **Tone:** Calm, supportive, and encouraging. The language should be simple yet profound, avoiding overly technical jargon or aggressive marketing speak.
